        <h1>Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h1>
        <h2>TO LEON WERTH</h2>
        <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he
        is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about
        children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these
        reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once
        children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>
        <h2>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h2>

        <h2>I</h2>
        <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called <span class="italic">True Stories from Nature</span>, about the primeval
        forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">In the book it said:</span> <i>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to
        move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><mark><sub>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.</sub> And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in
        making my first <sup>My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</sup></mark></sub>

        <p><s>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups</s>, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But they answered: <u><i>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</i></u></p>
